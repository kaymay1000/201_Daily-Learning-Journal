# LJ Code 201 - Day 2
Today is day two of Code201. There are times where I feel completely lost, and
then there are times where I want to do a glorious victory dance because I conquered
something that is probably really simple to anyone who has been coding for a while.
####The things I am starting to understand better:
-JavaScript
-Terminal
-GitHub

####The things I need to get better on are:
-JavaScript
-Terminal
-GitHub

All in all, things are going well, I have a long way to go and I have to remember
to keep on keeping on when times get tough. Also, remember the example you learned today.
```question1.toUpperCase() === 'YES'``` if prompt is lower case.
