# LJ Code 201 - Day 2
Today is day two of Code201. There are times where I feel completely lost, and
then there are times where I want to do a glorious victory dance because I conquered
something that is probably really simple to anyone who has been coding for a while.
#### The things I am starting to understand better:
-JavaScript
-Terminal
-GitHub

#### The things I need to get better on are:
-JavaScript
-Terminal
-GitHub

All in all, things are going well, I have a long way to go and I have to remember
to keep on keeping on when times get tough. Also, remember the example you learned today.
`question1.toUpperCase() === 'YES'`

# LJ Code 201- Day 2
Today was day 4 of Code 201. We went over functions and did our first paired partner lab.
It was very informative. I have been self teaching myself for a few months but I have never
explained my code to anyone before. This was informative because I realized how important it
is to describe your code. A man once said:
>"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand
it well enough".


I think his name was Albert Einstein or something. :)
