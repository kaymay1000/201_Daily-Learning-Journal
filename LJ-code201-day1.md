# LJ Code 201 - Day 2
Today is day two of Code201. There are times where I feel completely lost, and
then there are times where I want to do a glorious victory dance because I conquered
something that is probably really simple to anyone who has been coding for a while.
#### The things I am starting to understand better:
-JavaScript
-Terminal
-GitHub

#### The things I need to get better on are:
-JavaScript
-Terminal
-GitHub

All in all, things are going well, I have a long way to go and I have to remember
to keep on keeping on when times get tough. Also, remember the example you learned today.
`question1.toUpperCase() === 'YES'`

# LJ Code 201- Day 2
Today was day 4 of Code 201. We went over functions and did our first paired partner lab.
It was very informative. I have been self teaching myself for a few months but I have never
explained my code to anyone before. This was informative because I realized how important it
is to describe your code. A man once said:
>"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand
it well enough".


I think his name was Albert Einstein or something. :)

# LJ Code 201- Day 6
Today was day 6, we started our Salmon Cookie project. I am extremely occupied trying to figure out the correct code to complete my project. DOM is interesting, I don't fully grasp it yet but I will own it someday. I just have to keep pushing!

# LJ Code 201- Dat 8:
Today, we continued our Salmon Cookie project. It is getting more intense but I am continuing to learn about myself and this project. Persistence is key. There were times that I wanted to shut my laptop and go home but I kept pushing myself and made some decent strides. KEEP GOIN!

# LJ Code 201- Day 10:
Today is Friday. This week was incredibly challenging but you did it! You pushed through, learned a lot and still have a lot to learn. This project was difficult but I am glad I did it. The hardest part (JavaScript) is done. I just have to style my pages.
